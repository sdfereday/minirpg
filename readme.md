## The Challenge:
Create a really small RPG, try to aim for under 56kb (built).

### It must have:
- Movement
- Conversations (with choices)
- Interaction with things around the map
- Super simple inventory
- Animations
- Sound & music

### It doesn't need to have (but would be nice sometime):
- Combat (that's a whole new kettle of fish)
- Advanced inventory
- Reputation (based on conversations)
